			<p>We specialize in wedding photography, corporate, family and senior portraits, often traveling to your destination to capture the perfect moment in the perfect place.

We will be there with you every step of the way to guarantee your special moments are captured for all time.

            To us photography is about people being real and then letting us paint a picture of that moment to remember it foreve. This is the story that matters most: real people, real stories, real moments.

            Matt, I have been raving and bragging to everyone about Matt Mason Photography and will forever speak highly of you any chance I can.  Joel and I stayed up until 3:00am the night of our wedding going through your phenomenal photos!. 

            Love Matt Mason Photography! Matt, Max and Nick did an AMAZING job on our wedding photos/video. They were communicative, easy to work with, creative, informative and helpful w/many aspects. Their timeliness of getting our photos/videos/album to us was amazing! We are so lucky to have these memories captured for a lifetime. 'Thank you' doesn't even describe how grateful we are to them!
